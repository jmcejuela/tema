I would first like to thank my supervisor Pr. Burkhard Rost for his support and opportunity to do my master's thesis in his group.

A great thanks goes to my thesis advisor Juan Miguel Cejuela. His guidance in research, organization, communication, and bioinformatics, was evident and encouraging in every moment of my thesis.

I want to extend my gratitude to the whole Rostlab group for creating a great environment to work at. Special thanks goes to Tim Karl, who kindly responded to all my requests.
