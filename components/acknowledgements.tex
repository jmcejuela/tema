I would first like to thank my supervisor prof Burkhard Rost for his support and opportunity to do my master's thesis in his group.

 A great thanks goes for my advisor Juan Miguel Cejuela for his advises during thesis. His advises in research, organization, communication and bioinformatic were  evident in every moment during the period of thesis.  

I want  to extend my gratitude to the whole Rostlab group for creating a great environment to work in. Special thanks go to Tim Karl, who responded in every my request.
